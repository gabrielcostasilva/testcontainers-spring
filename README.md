# TESTCONTAINERS - SELENIDE/SELENIUM GRID
This Spring Boot project uses Testcontainers for testing persistence with a MySQL database. [_Testcontainers_](https://testcontainers.com) is a framework that uses Docker containers to run tests against dependencies, such as databases.

> This branch extends the [spring-3](https://github.com/gabrielcostasilva/testcontainers-spring/tree/spring-3) project by using Selenide along with Selenium Grid to carry out an end-to-end test.

To learn more about end-to-end tests check out [this repository](https://github.com/gabrielcostasilva/testcontainers-selenide.git).
